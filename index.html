 <p>The strategic assessment evaluates how close the respective option brings you to reach your target. Not all options will have the same effectiveness. E.g. if your target is to reduce the emissions, not every option will have the same impact to reach this target. Module 5 and 6 will provide you with more insights into the effectiveness of various measures.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, strategic options rarely come without costs. At the same time, firms still need to earn money. In the first module, you learned already about the relationship between profit and purpose. The article on purpose that you got to know during this module provided you with further input on this relationship. In Module 8 you will learn more about financing sustainability and how to evaluate the financial side of your strategic options. You will then be able to judge upon the financial impact of your strategic options. An important aspect that cannot be ignored when it comes to deciding which strategic option to go for.</p>

<div class="accordion">Feasibility <i class="fa-solid fa-plus accordion-right"></i></div>
<div class="panel hidden">

  <p>Last but not least we need to assess and take into consideration the feasibility of the strategic options. Do we have the financial resources to implement it? Do we have enough time and manpower to implement it? Are there maybe legal or cultural obstacles that put the success of the strategic option at risk? These are relevant questions that we have to answer with all honesty.</p>
